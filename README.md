# Beautiful-Horiseons
Hey guys this is my repo for week one's challenge where I optimized code from an existing webpage owned by social solutions firm, Horiseons.  
In this project, social solutions firm Horiseon, requested me to help them with improving their existing website by refactoring both their html and css file.
I met the customers needs by eliminating unneccessary code tags and redundancy in the css selectors through consolidation and optimization
I Hope you enjoy!
